MAVEN ROASTERS - STATISTICAL ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================


STATISTICAL TESTS PERFORMED:
1. ANOVA - Store revenue comparison
2. T-tests - Pairwise store comparisons
3. Chi-square - Product category preferences
4. Correlation analysis - Variable relationships
5. Peak vs off-peak significance testing

    
HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
Store Revenue Differences (ANOVA):
  F-statistic: 37.1998
  P-value: 0.000000
  Result: SIGNIFICANT (p < 0.05)
  
Interpretation: Revenue differences between stores are 
statistically significant and not due to random chance

    
KEY STATISTICAL FINDINGS:
✓ Store performance differences are statistically valid
✓ Product preferences differ significantly by location
✓ Peak hours show significant difference from off-peak
✓ Patterns identified are actionable, not random noise
    
    
CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
All significant results reported at 95% confidence level (p < 0.05)
This means less than 5% chance findings are due to random variation
